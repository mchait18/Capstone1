I used the API called - https://spoonacular.com/ in order to create a mealplanner that you will find at: https://mealplans.onrender.com/
My website allows a user to search for recipes, add his favorites to a recipe box, and/or add them to a day of the week on his 7-day mealplaner.
Once a meal is added to the mealplanner, there is a shopping list that is populated with the ingredients for that recipe. 
The user signs up to the website and once he's registered, he can search for recipes, add/delete them to/from a recipe box and mealplanner and the shopping list will update accordingly, based on the recipes in his mealplanner.
The user can then pull up his shopping list checklist to check off which ingredients he has already to know what he needs to buy.
I used Python with FLASK and SQLAlchemy, HTML, CSS and bootstrap
